# Fake News Detection using Natural Language Processing (NLP)

## Project Overview

Fake news has become a significant issue in today's digital age, affecting public opinion, political events, and societal beliefs. This project aims to address the challenge of fake news detection using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. By analyzing the content, style, and credibility of news articles, this project provides a tool for distinguishing between legitimate and fake news.

## Features

- **Text Preprocessing**: Cleans and prepares news articles for analysis.
- **Feature Extraction**: Extracts key features such as word embeddings, sentiment scores, and linguistic patterns.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implements various machine learning algorithms to classify news articles as fake or real.
- **Deep Learning Models**: Utilizes deep learning techniques for improved accuracy and handling of complex data patterns.
- **User Interface**: A simple web interface for users to input news articles and receive detection results.
- **Visualizations**: Provides visual insights into model predictions and data patterns.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language used for the project.
- **Natural Language Processing**: NLTK, SpaCy, or Hugging Face Transformers for text processing.
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn for traditional machine learning models.
- **Deep Learning**: TensorFlow or PyTorch for neural network models.
- **Web Framework**: Flask or Django for the web application.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL or MongoDB for storing news articles and results.
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly for data visualization.

## Dataset

The project uses the [Fake News Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset) from Kaggle, which contains labeled news articles categorized as fake or real. The dataset is preprocessed to remove duplicates, null values, and irrelevant data before training the models.

## Installation

Thgis projest uses
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

You can install this libraries using `pip`:

   ```bash
   pip install .
   ```

   You can also install these libraries with `poetry`:
   
   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fake-news-detection.git
   cd fake-news-detection

2. Create a Virtual Environment

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

3. Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt
Download the Dataset

4. Download the dataset from Kaggle and place it in the data/ directory.

5. Set Up the Database

Follow the instructions in setup_database.md to configure the database.

# Usage
To run the project, execute the following command:

python app.py
# Web Interface
Open a web browser and go to http://localhost:5000 to access the user interface.
Enter a news article in the input field and click "Analyze" to determine if it's fake or real.

# Command Line Interface
You can also use the command line interface to analyze news articles:

python analyze.py --article "Your news article here"

# Model Training
To train the machine learning models, run:


python train.py --model <model_name>
Replace <model_name> with logistic_regression, random_forest, svm, or neural_network.

# Results and Evaluation
The project achieves an accuracy of approximately 92% using a combination of machine learning and deep learning models. Detailed evaluation metrics, such as precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices, are available in the results/ directory.

# Visualization
Explore the visualization/ directory for scripts that generate insights into the data and model performance, including:

Word cloud of most common words in fake vs. real news.
ROC curves for different models.
Feature importance charts.
